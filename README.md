# CodingDojo in PHP Symfony & PHPUnit

## Set-up

To set up the environment, I built a traditional web application with `symfony new --webapp my_project` using Symfony CLI.
I also installed PHPUnit with `composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit`.

## Summary

This repository contains katas with instructions from the [CodingDojo.org](https://codingdojo.org) website.
It is organised as follows:
- the instructions in a markdown file and a possible solution are in a dedicated folder under `src/Model`, and
- the corresponding test in `tests/Model`.

The following katas are covered:
- [Leap Years Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/LeapYears/)
- [FizzBuzz](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/)
